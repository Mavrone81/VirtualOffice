# Enshrine VirtualOffice — production image (Next.js standalone).
# Pinned by digest for reproducible builds. Shared by deps, builder, migrator,
# tools AND runner — the production image — so this is a production-image
# determinism change. Trade: no Alpine/Node security fix arrives until this is
# deliberately bumped. node:22-alpine = NODE_VERSION 22.23.3, image created
# 2026-09-23, digest resolved 2026-09-27.

# pnpm from the npm registry at container start, on the droplet, during

# so pnpm stays reachable whichever user this stage runs as. Without it,

# accident of this stage having no USER directive: add one and corepack silently
# goes back to fetching pnpm from the npm registry at container start, on the
# droplet, during every deploy's migrate. Asserted unconditionally by
# lib/dockerfile-corepack.test.ts so the check has teeth on every run.

# the lib/server/prisma sources they import, tsx and a generated Prisma client:
# no Next build, no .env (.dockerignore), and NO secrets or placeholder secrets in
# ENV. Every value a script needs is passed at run time, one allow-listed variable
