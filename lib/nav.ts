    // below) are folded in here.
    //
    // "Team Overview" is REMOVED, not merged in as its own item: the owner
    // ruled its page and "Recruitment Dashboard" are the same underlying
    // page, kept as one canonical page at /portal/team (the former Team
    // Overview route — its 4 stat tiles stay, the All/Direct/Downline tabs
    // this item used to point to are added to it). This item's href moves
    // to /portal/team; the labelKey stays `recruitmentDashboard` (its
    // existing translation already reads "Team Dashboard") to avoid an
    // unforced key rename — only the destination page changed.
    //
    // Locked order (owner-confirmed, 2026-10-03; C11 trimmed it to four):
    // Team Dashboard, Team Performance, Split Approvals, Invite Candidate.
    // Team Sales and Team Commissions were folded into Team Performance
    // (C11) and their routes redirect there. An earlier "Associate List" item was a relay error, not a
    // real client ask — Additional p9's associate list is the content of
    // Team Dashboard's own tabs, not a separate menu entry.
    //
    // Gating is NOT "copy each item's old nav gate forward," and an
    // earlier pass of this comment got it wrong in the other direction —
    // worth leaving the correction in place. FOUR items here each answer to
    // their OWN real authority; a nav/route mismatch only tells you one
    // side is stale, never which, so each was resolved by reading that
    // item's actual action/route-level check, not by picking a role set
    // that looked plausible:
    //   - Team Dashboard (recruitmentDashboard, /portal/team): OPEN to
    //     every associate, same as always — this is A8 (Additional p8/p9/
    //     p10), a DELIVERED client row. The page differentiates by CONTENT,
    //     not nav visibility: RecruitmentView's own `eligible =
    //     canRecruit(role)` branch (RECRUITER_ROLES = SalesManager/
    //     SalesDirector/Admin, NOT SalesAssistantManager) renders the
    //     tiles+roster for a recruiter and the "not eligible yet" card
    //     otherwise — unchanged by this merge. app/portal/team/layout.tsx
    //     no longer gates this subtree by role (it did briefly, during
    //     this same change — that was wrong, see its own comment); it only
    //     requires login now, so nav and route agree for every role here.
    //   - Team Performance (downlinePerformance, /portal/team/performance):
    //     OPEN to every associate, no `roles` — like Team Dashboard, it
    //     differentiates by CONTENT. isManagerRole (SAM/SM/SD, no Admin)
    //     gets the team sales + commission view; everyone else gets the
    //     RecruitmentView downline branch (or its "not eligible" card). The
    //     team-wide queries are guarded by role inside
    //     server/team/performance.ts, not just hidden in the page.
    //   - Split Approvals (/portal/approvals): DIRECTOR_ROLES, matching
    //     that page's own Director/Admin check — unaffected by this merge.
    //   - Invite Candidate (/portal/recruitment/new): RECRUITER_ROLES,
    //     unaffected — unrelated route.
    // Quota-editing on the Team Dashboard's roster table is a FOURTH,
    // separate authority again (canSetQuota, SAM and above, cell-level in
    // server/quota/actions.ts) — untouched by any of this, and not the same
    // role set as either canRecruit or the route gate. A Sales Assistant
    // Manager is the one role where all three disagree: not a recruiter
    // (gets the "not eligible" card, no roster), but can reach the route
    // and can set quota — each on its own check, never collapsed into one.
