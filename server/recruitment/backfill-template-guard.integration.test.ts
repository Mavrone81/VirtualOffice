// The template provenance guard, proven on the SCRIPT, against a real database
// and real stored objects — not on the decision function in isolation (that is
// lib/pdf/agreement-template-guard.test.ts).
//
// What this file has to establish that a unit test cannot:
//   1. the script actually consults the guard at all — a guard module nothing
//      imports is just a file;
//   2. a refusal happens BEFORE the first write, so "abort" means "refused to
//      start" and not "stopped halfway through overwriting signed documents".
//      Every refusal case below therefore asserts that the stored bytes of
//      EVERY fixture row are byte-identical afterwards, and that no .bak was
//      created — the only honest way to say "nothing was written";
//   3. the differential half: the same script, same fixtures, WRITES when the
//      provenance is good. Without that, a guard that refused unconditionally
//      (or a script that silently no-ops) would pass every refusal assertion.
//
// Row counts are asserted explicitly throughout, and the fixture set is pinned
// to exactly the rows the script will see. The backfill selects every candidate
// in the table with a signedAgreementFileKey, so a stray row from another test
// file would change what is under test; the count assertions turn that into a
// loud failure instead of a quiet one. A refusal test that ran over zero rows
// would otherwise pass while proving nothing at all.
