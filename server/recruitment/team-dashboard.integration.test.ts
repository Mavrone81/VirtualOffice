// Team Dashboard (C-8, 02 Oct 2026): proves Contact (mobile number, email)
// and Date of Birth are SELECTED OUT of the Team Dashboard's associate read,
// not merely unused by what the table renders. The owner's Q6 answer: these
// were deliberately removed from an upline's view of their downline on 22 Sep
// (PDPA) and that stands — the PDF's p.9 mockup columns are the pre-22-Sep
// shape and are not coming back. A UI-only check (asserting the rendered
// <th>/<td> list) would pass even if the component received the field and
// simply chose not to print it; this tests the raw prisma rows
// (fetchTeamDashboardAssociates), the server response the UI is built from.
